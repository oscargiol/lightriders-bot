=================

Source code extracted from riddles.io for the AI game Light Riders.
https://playground.riddles.io/competitions/light-riders

##Make the bot smarter

The bot main logic is located in the method doMove in BotStarter.java.
As you can see, in this code the bot movements are random (maybe someone thinks this is a good idea), 
so this is the method you will have to change to make your bot as clever as you want.

##Build the bot 

The project is configured with Maven framework to build a jar with the main class BotStarter.
So, no worries about project structure, just run maven package and get your awesome bot jar.

## How to run it 

In order to run matches locally you will need to get the riddles.io workspace:
https://github.com/jmerle/ai-bot-workspace

The easiest way is just download the exe file and run it.

Open the application, choose the Light Riders game and then edit the settings specifying the path to the different bot jars.
